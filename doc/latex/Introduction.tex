\section{Purpose of this Document}
\label{sec:Purpose}

Instead of giving the students a lot of Powerpoint slides that compress the complex topics of this course into a bunch of bullet points, we wanted the students to have a dedicated document for preparing their exam. Unfortunately, such a document is a lot more work and it needs several iterations of thorough reviewing. Therefore, we came up with the compromise that the students write this document theirselves and the lecturers only have to review and improve it. 

Maybe you ask: "What is wrong with Powerpoint?" 

A Powerpoint presentation should aid a presenter in presenting a certain message or information to his audience. The slides alone often miss critical parts (that couldn't easily condensed into bullet points) and are unclear without the corresponding vocal line of the presenter. Nevertheless, students end up alone with the slides trying to prepare their examinations.

Apart from that, try to google topics like "disadvantages of powerpoint" or "why we should ban Powerpoint" and you will find interesting articles that connect Powerpoint and the Accident of the Columbia Space Shuttle [\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-powerpoint-makes-you-dumb.html}{1}] [\href{http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1&topic=Ask+E%2eT%2e}{2}].

\section{How to contribute to this document?}
\label{sec:Contribute}

Basically there are two aspects. At first you need to get the \LaTeX\  source code of this document from our \href{https://github.com/carpe-noctem-cassel/cnc-turtlebots}{cnc-turtlebots GitHub Repository}. It is located in the folder \verb#doc/latex#. Anybody can download it, but for making changes to it you need to have an GitHub-Account which was given the corresponding previliges. That is typically arranged during the first session of this course. 

This leaves us with the requirements, that you are able to write \LaTeX\ and know how to use GIT in combination with GitHub. Regarding GIT and GitHub we recommend to read Section~\ref{sec:Git}. 

\LaTeX\ maybe is hard to master, when it comes to tables, graphics and customizing the layout of a document, but nothing of it you have to do for contributing to this document. You should be able to structure the content into chapters, sections, and subsections. Furthermore, you should be able to write text referencing images and place  useful links from time to time. Everything just mentioned is already done in this document, so you can start by copying commands from the corresponding sections.
