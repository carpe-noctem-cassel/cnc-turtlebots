\section{Purpose of this Document}
\label{sec:Purpose}

Instead of giving the students a lot of Powerpoint slides that compress the complex topics of this course into a bunch of bullet points, we wanted the students to have a dedicated document for preparing their exam. Unfortunately, such a document is a lot more work and it needs several iterations of thorough reviewing. Therefore, we came up with the compromise that the students write this document theirselves and the lecturers only have to review and improve it. 

Maybe you ask: "What is wrong with Powerpoint?" 

A Powerpoint presentation should aid a presenter in presenting a certain message or information to his audience. The slides alone often miss critical parts (that couldn't easily condensed into bullet points) and are unclear without the corresponding vocal line of the presenter. Nevertheless, students end up alone with the slides trying to prepare their examinations.

Apart from that, try to google topics like "disadvantages of powerpoint" or "why we should ban Powerpoint" and you will find interesting articles that connect Powerpoint and the Accident of the Columbia Space Shuttle [\href{http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-powerpoint-makes-you-dumb.html}{1}] [\href{http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1&topic=Ask+E%2eT%2e}{2}].
