[Processes]

	# Interpreted executables, like the roscore, have the interpreter as first command line parameter, which 
	# makes extra handling necessary. Please list your interpreter here, for this purpose. 
	Interpreter = python, java
	
	[ProcessDescriptions]
		# MODES: 
		# Available modes for processes are ...
		# keepAlive 	- restarts it automatically if it is crashed
		# none 			- don't restart after crashes
		# autostart 	- start the process at process manager start and keep it alive
		
		# PARAMETERS: 
		# If a process has parameters, they are added in a extra section called [paramSets] ... [!paramSets].
		# Inside this section each parameter set is a single key-value pair of the form "<number> = <param1>, <param2>, <param3>".
		# It is important for the key to be a positive integer, in order to define the parameters in the bundles section (at the end of this file). 
		# The number "0" is reserved for "no params", so if your process does not have any parameters, ommit the paramSets-Section and use "0" 
		# in the bundles section. The first entry in the paramSets-Section, if it exists, will be the default parameter set for your process.
		# The number "-1" is reserved for "unknown params", so don't use -1 in this file.
	
		# The roscore is specially handled by the process manager, as it is necessary for him to communicate.
