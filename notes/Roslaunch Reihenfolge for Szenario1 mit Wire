Tutorial playing around with Turtlebot and Wire

# Install the turtle_szenario1 package in one of your workspaces or create a new one for it. Then build the package via catkin_make. Don't forget to source the Workspace and be sure the ros-version is set to indigo ! 

# If you have not installed gazebo yet, do it ... you will need it.

# Download and Install Kobuki
> wstool init <Install-Folder> -j5 https://raw.github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_tools/master/rosinstalls/indigo/kobuki.rosinstall
> rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
> catkin_make
> source the Workspace if you have created a new one for kobuki or if your Workspace in which kobuki is, is not sourced so far.

# I assume you have already build and sourced wire at this point.

# Dont forget to set Environment Variable ED_PLUGIN_PATH before !

# Start the Szenario
1. roslaunch turtle_szenario1 turtle_szenario1.launch
2. roslaunch kobuki_keyop keyop.launch
3. rosrun rgbd rgbd_viewer rgbd:=/kinect/rgbd
