How to install kinect for ros on Ubuntu 14.04

- first install Openni
-> sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-camera ros-indigo-openni-launch
-> this will automatically install also the primesense framework stuff ... 

- second install the right driver (SensorKinect/PrimeSense Sensor Module for OpenNI)
-> git clone git://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect.git
-> cd SensorKinect/Platform/Linux/CreateRedist/
-> chmod +x RedistMaker
-> ./RedistMaker
-> cd ../Redist/Sensor-Bin-Linux-.../
-> chmod +x install.sh
-> sudo ./install.sh



now all stuff you need for getting kinect running on the turtlebot and ubuntu 14.04 should be installed.
